# PHP Movie Database
PHP Movie Database I made as final project for [Algebra](https://www.algebra.hr/) PHP course.

Site Demo (on heroku): [Demo](https://php-movie-database.herokuapp.com/)

Features
--------

Features that were needed for passing the course: 

- MySQL Database "kolekcija" with tables "zanr" and "filmovi"
- "index.php" filtering movies from database through menu of letters ranging A-Z
- "unos.php" with two parts. First part is form for adding movies in the database. Second part shows all added movies from database with information and action delete
